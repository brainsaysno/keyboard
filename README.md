Suup, this is the ZMK config for my latest Corne build. I'm rocking nice!nano v2s and those fancy Nice!View displays because I like the aesthetics, but it shouldn't be too complicated to adapt the layout to other builds.

## My personal layout
It's a 3x6 Corne split.
- **Base:** QWERTY-ish. Standard stuff.
- **Lower:** Numbers and media controls. DJ mode engaged.
- **Raise:** Symbols. For when I need to feel like a hacker.

## Cool tweaks

## Usage
Flash it, plug it in, type words. Also, there's a github action to build it which should be the easiest workflow :)

If you copy this and your keyboard starts mining crypto, that's a feature, not a bug. Also, I take no responsibility for tendinitis.

Enjoy.
